# CoachMe-poolpage_studentfilter

contains:
- student pool
- coach pool
- filter page for student pool

Note:
- now the main_activity.xml is used as the student pool page
MainActivity.kt also binds to main_activity
.xml and feed dummy data to the student pool page
- clicking the SORT button on student pool page will lead to coach pool page (easier for testing)
